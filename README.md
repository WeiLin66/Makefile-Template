# Simple Makefile Templates for Developers

If your project's structure is similar to:

- src/
- include/
- Makefile

which src/ folder contains all the source files, and include folder contains all the headers, then just fetch and use **Project_Template** as the Template

However, if your project looks like this:

- part1
    - src/
    - include/
- part2
    - src/
    - include/
- main.c
- Makefile

in this case, I suggest you to use **Multi_Driver_Template** and modify it to best suit your project
